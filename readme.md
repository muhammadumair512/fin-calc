1. open proj while clicking on index.html file
2. now first you have to Choose Policy Type and then economic condition (note:- you can't choose economic condition prior to policy type)
3. once you will choose both, initial values of GDP, unemployment and inflation will be displayed
4. you need to adjust these parameters via entering values in input boxes below it . Once user input any value in inputs he has to select b/w positive / buy or negative / sell buttons to represent whether entered values are positive or negative
5. after entering desired values press calculate changes now calculations will be done on bases of your entered values and resultant values will be shown in table above progress bar
6. progress bar shows no of iterations / years you are left with (total 10 chances are given to you for stabilizing economy)
7. if user achieves ' GDP >2%, Unemployment < 4%, and Inflation 0% < x < 3%' then alert will be displayed "you achieve stabilize economy" else alert will appears after 10th try "please try again"
8. winning conditions can be changed in code via following below instructions:-
   a. open script.js file using any text / code editor ( like notepad, VS code etc)
   b. search for (press ctrl + f on windows / command + f on mac ) ' winning criteria '  
    c. a piece of code (as shown in attached .png) will be shown you can ammend it to change winning criteria
9. user can finish simulation if he has achieved results at any stage by pressing Finalize scenerio button
10. all simulations results are shown in table at bottom
11. thank you.
